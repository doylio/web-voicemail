# Ticket #2: Deployment Configuration

## Description

Set up Vercel deployment configuration and environment variable management for hosting the answering machine app on the free tier.

## Priority

High - Required for testing and production deployment

## Dependencies

- Ticket #1: Project Setup (must be completed first)

## Acceptance Criteria

### Vercel Configuration

- [ ] Connect GitHub repository to Vercel
- [ ] Configure Vercel project settings for Next.js
- [ ] Set up automatic deployments on push to main branch
- [ ] Configure build settings for optimal performance on free tier
- [ ] Verify deployment works with placeholder content

### Environment Variables Setup

- [ ] Configure Dropbox API credentials in Vercel environment variables:
  - `DROPBOX_APP_KEY`
  - `DROPBOX_APP_SECRET`
  - `DROPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN` (or refresh token setup)
- [ ] Set up environment variable validation
- [ ] Create local development environment variable template
- [ ] Document environment variable setup process

### Performance Optimization

- [ ] Configure Next.js for static generation where possible
- [ ] Optimize build output size for Vercel limits
- [ ] Set up proper caching headers
- [ ] Configure compression settings
- [ ] Verify app stays within Vercel free tier limits

### Domain & SSL

- [ ] Set up custom domain (if provided) or use Vercel subdomain
- [ ] Ensure SSL/HTTPS is properly configured
- [ ] Test deployment accessibility from various networks

### Monitoring & Error Handling

- [ ] Set up basic error monitoring (Vercel Analytics if needed)
- [ ] Configure deployment notifications
- [ ] Set up preview deployments for pull requests
- [ ] Test rollback procedures

## Technical Notes

- Use Vercel's free tier (Hobby plan)
- Ensure all assets are optimized for fast loading
- Configure for client-side only architecture (minimal API routes)
- Plan for direct client-to-Dropbox uploads to avoid server bandwidth

## Definition of Done

- App successfully deploys to Vercel
- Environment variables are properly configured
- Deployment process is automated
- Performance is optimized for free tier
- Domain and SSL are working correctly
- Basic monitoring is in place
