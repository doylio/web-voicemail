# Ticket #7: Dropbox API Integration & Audio Recording

## Description

Implement HTML5 Audio API for microphone recording and integrate Dropbox API for secure authentication and file upload capabilities.

## Priority

High - Core functionality

## Dependencies

- Ticket #1: Project Setup (dependencies needed)
- Ticket #2: Deployment Configuration (environment variables needed)

## Acceptance Criteria

### Audio Recording Implementation

- [ ] Implement microphone access using HTML5 MediaRecorder API
- [ ] Handle browser microphone permission requests
- [ ] Create audio recording functionality with start/stop controls
- [ ] Implement real-time recording duration tracking
- [ ] Set up audio input level monitoring (for visual feedback)
- [ ] Handle microphone access denied scenarios gracefully

### Browser Compatibility

- [ ] Test audio recording on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- [ ] Implement fallbacks for older browsers where possible
- [ ] Handle browser-specific audio format differences
- [ ] Test on mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Android Chrome)
- [ ] Provide clear error messages for unsupported browsers

### Dropbox API Integration

- [ ] Set up Dropbox App and obtain API credentials
- [ ] Implement Dropbox OAuth2 authentication flow
- [ ] Create secure token management system
- [ ] Set up API client for file upload operations
- [ ] Handle Dropbox API rate limits and errors
- [ ] Implement token refresh mechanism if needed

### Security & Authentication

- [ ] Secure API key management (environment variables)
- [ ] Implement client-side token generation if needed
- [ ] Ensure no sensitive credentials are exposed to client
- [ ] Set up proper CORS configuration
- [ ] Handle authentication errors gracefully
- [ ] Implement secure upload URL generation

### Audio Format Configuration

- [ ] Configure recording format (WAV initially for quality)
- [ ] Set appropriate sample rate and bit depth
- [ ] Prepare for MP3 conversion integration
- [ ] Ensure audio quality meets requirements
- [ ] Test audio quality across different devices

### Error Handling

- [ ] Handle microphone permission denied
- [ ] Manage network connectivity issues
- [ ] Handle Dropbox authentication failures
- [ ] Provide user-friendly error messages
- [ ] Implement retry mechanisms for transient failures
- [ ] Log errors appropriately for debugging

### File Management

- [ ] Generate unique filenames with timestamps
- [ ] Set up proper file naming convention (message-YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS)
- [ ] Configure upload to specific Dropbox folder
- [ ] Handle file size limitations
- [ ] Implement upload progress tracking

### Performance Considerations

- [ ] Optimize memory usage during recording
- [ ] Handle large audio files efficiently
- [ ] Implement streaming upload where possible
- [ ] Monitor and optimize upload speeds
- [ ] Test performance on slower devices

## Technical Notes

- Use MediaRecorder API for recording (supported in modern browsers)
- Implement proper error boundaries for audio functionality
- Consider using Web Workers for audio processing if needed
- Plan for future MP3 encoding integration
- Ensure HTTPS is required for microphone access

## Environment Variables Required

- `DROPBOX_APP_KEY` - Dropbox application key
- `DROPBOX_APP_SECRET` - Dropbox application secret
- `DROPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN` - Access token for uploads

## Definition of Done

- Audio recording works reliably across target browsers
- Dropbox API integration is secure and functional
- File uploads complete successfully to designated folder
- Error handling provides clear user feedback
- Performance is acceptable on target devices
- Security best practices are implemented
