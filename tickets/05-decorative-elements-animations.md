# Ticket #5: Decorative Elements & Animations

## Description

Add non-functional decorative buttons (play, stop, rewind) for aesthetic appeal and implement animated spinning tape reels that activate during recording.

## Priority

Medium - Enhances skeuomorphic experience

## Dependencies

- Ticket #3: Base Skeuomorphic Design (design foundation needed)
- Ticket #4: Recording Controls UI (for animation triggers)

## Acceptance Criteria

### Decorative Control Buttons

- [ ] Create realistic play, stop, and rewind buttons
- [ ] Design buttons with proper skeuomorphic styling:
  - Raised/embossed appearance
  - Appropriate symbols (▶️, ⏹️, ⏪)
  - Tactile button feel with shadows and highlights
- [ ] Position buttons logically around the main interface
- [ ] Make buttons visually interactive but non-functional:
  - Subtle hover effects
  - Press-down animation on click
  - Return to normal state without functionality
- [ ] Ensure buttons complement the overall design aesthetic

### Tape Reel Animation System

- [ ] Create two circular tape reel elements positioned appropriately
- [ ] Design realistic tape reel appearance:
  - Hub with spoke details
  - Tape wound around the reel
  - Proper proportions and depth
- [ ] Implement smooth spinning animation:
  - Start spinning when recording begins
  - Maintain consistent rotation speed
  - Stop when recording ends
  - Different speeds for different reels (realistic tape movement)

### Animation Controls

- [ ] Synchronize tape reel animations with recording state
- [ ] Implement smooth start/stop transitions (not abrupt)
- [ ] Add subtle easing for natural movement
- [ ] Ensure animations don't impact performance
- [ ] Provide option to disable animations for accessibility

### Additional Visual Elements

- [ ] Add speaker grille or mesh areas
- [ ] Include brand/model label area
- [ ] Create subtle LED indicators for different states
- [ ] Add realistic device details (screws, joints, etc.)
- [ ] Implement subtle ambient animations (breathing LED, etc.)

### Performance Optimization

- [ ] Use CSS transforms for smooth animations
- [ ] Minimize repaints and reflows
- [ ] Test performance on lower-end devices
- [ ] Implement animation frame rate optimization
- [ ] Ensure animations can be paused/stopped if needed

### Accessibility Considerations

- [ ] Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` user preference
- [ ] Provide alternative indicators for animation states
- [ ] Ensure animations don't interfere with screen readers
- [ ] Test with various accessibility tools
- [ ] Include animation controls for sensitive users

## Technical Notes

- Use CSS animations and transforms for best performance
- Implement proper animation lifecycle management
- Plan for future integration with audio visualizations
- Ensure animations work across different browsers
- Consider battery usage on mobile devices

## Assets Needed

- Button icons/symbols (SVG preferred)
- Tape reel graphic elements
- Any texture overlays for realistic appearance

## Definition of Done

- All decorative buttons are visually appealing and interactive
- Tape reel animations work smoothly and realistically
- Animations are properly synchronized with recording state
- Performance is optimized for all target devices
- Accessibility requirements are met
- Overall skeuomorphic feel is enhanced
