# Ticket #9: Dropbox Upload Integration

## Description

Connect the encoded MP3 audio files to Dropbox upload functionality, implementing direct client-to-Dropbox upload with proper error handling and user feedback.

## Priority

High - Core functionality completion

## Dependencies

- Ticket #7: Dropbox API Integration & Audio Recording (API setup needed)
- Ticket #8: MP3 Encoding (encoded files needed)

## Acceptance Criteria

### Upload Flow Integration

- [ ] Connect MP3 encoding output directly to Dropbox upload
- [ ] Implement seamless workflow: Record → Encode → Upload → Confirm
- [ ] Handle upload process without page refresh or navigation
- [ ] Ensure upload begins automatically after encoding completes
- [ ] Maintain proper state management throughout upload process

### File Upload Implementation

- [ ] Implement direct client-to-Dropbox file upload
- [ ] Use Dropbox API upload endpoints appropriately
- [ ] Handle large file uploads (up to 10-minute recordings)
- [ ] Implement chunked upload for larger files if needed
- [ ] Ensure uploads are resumable where possible

### Upload Progress & Feedback

- [ ] Show real-time upload progress to user
- [ ] Display upload percentage and estimated time remaining
- [ ] Provide visual feedback during upload process
- [ ] Update digital display with upload status
- [ ] Show final confirmation when upload completes

### File Naming & Organization

- [ ] Generate timestamped filenames (message-YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS.mp3)
- [ ] Upload files to designated Dropbox folder
- [ ] Ensure filenames are unique and sortable
- [ ] Include timezone information in filename if needed
- [ ] Handle filename conflicts gracefully

### Error Handling & Recovery

- [ ] Handle network interruptions during upload
- [ ] Implement retry mechanisms for failed uploads
- [ ] Provide clear error messages for upload failures
- [ ] Handle Dropbox API errors (rate limits, storage full, etc.)
- [ ] Allow users to retry failed uploads
- [ ] Fallback options for persistent upload failures

### Upload Success Flow

- [ ] Display success confirmation message
- [ ] Reset recording interface for next message
- [ ] Update LocalStorage counter for recording limits
- [ ] Provide feedback about remaining recording slots
- [ ] Clear any temporary files or data

### Security & Privacy

- [ ] Ensure upload tokens are secure and time-limited
- [ ] Validate file types and sizes before upload
- [ ] Handle authentication errors appropriately
- [ ] Ensure no sensitive data is logged or exposed
- [ ] Implement proper CORS handling

### Performance Optimization

- [ ] Optimize upload speed and reliability
- [ ] Handle concurrent operations efficiently
- [ ] Minimize memory usage during upload
- [ ] Test upload performance on various network conditions
- [ ] Implement appropriate timeouts

### Network Resilience

- [ ] Handle slow network connections gracefully
- [ ] Implement proper timeout handling
- [ ] Provide feedback for network-related delays
- [ ] Handle mobile network switches (WiFi to cellular)
- [ ] Test on various connection speeds

### User Experience Polish

- [ ] Smooth transitions between recording, encoding, and uploading states
- [ ] Clear visual indicators for each stage of the process
- [ ] Appropriate loading states and animations
- [ ] Prevent user from starting new recording during upload
- [ ] Handle browser tab switching/closing during upload

## Technical Notes

- Use Dropbox's file upload API with proper authentication
- Implement proper state management for async operations
- Consider using Service Workers for background uploads if needed
- Plan for proper cleanup of temporary data
- Ensure uploads work in private/incognito browser modes

## Error Scenarios to Handle

- Network disconnection during upload
- Dropbox storage quota exceeded
- Invalid authentication tokens
- File too large for upload
- Temporary Dropbox service issues

## Definition of Done

- Encoded MP3 files upload successfully to Dropbox
- Upload progress is clearly communicated to users
- Error handling provides appropriate user feedback
- Upload process is reliable across different network conditions
- Integration with existing recording flow is seamless
- All edge cases and error scenarios are handled gracefully
