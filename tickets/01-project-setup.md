# Ticket #1: Project Setup

## Description

Initialize a Next.js project with all necessary dependencies, proper folder structure, and development environment configuration for the skeuomorphic answering machine web app.

## Priority

High - Blocking for all other development

## Acceptance Criteria

### Project Initialization

- [ ] Create new Next.js project using `create-next-app`
- [ ] Configure TypeScript support
- [ ] Set up proper folder structure:
  - `/components` - React components
  - `/styles` - CSS/styling files
  - `/lib` - Utility functions and API helpers
  - `/public` - Static assets (images, sounds)
  - `/types` - TypeScript type definitions

### Dependencies Installation

- [ ] Install audio recording dependencies:
  - `recordrtc` or similar for audio recording
  - Audio encoding library for MP3 conversion
- [ ] Install Dropbox API dependencies:
  - `dropbox` SDK
- [ ] Install UI/styling dependencies:
  - CSS-in-JS solution or styling framework
  - Animation libraries if needed
- [ ] Install development dependencies:
  - ESLint configuration
  - Prettier for code formatting

### Development Environment

- [ ] Configure ESLint with Next.js rules
- [ ] Set up Prettier configuration
- [ ] Create `.gitignore` with appropriate exclusions
- [ ] Set up environment variables structure (`.env.local.example`)
- [ ] Create basic `README.md` with setup instructions

### Initial Project Structure

- [ ] Create placeholder components for main sections
- [ ] Set up basic routing structure
- [ ] Configure initial TypeScript types
- [ ] Ensure project runs successfully with `npm run dev`

## Technical Notes

- Use Next.js 14+ with App Router
- Configure for static generation where possible to optimize for Vercel hosting
- Ensure all dependencies are compatible with browser-based audio recording
- Plan for client-side only architecture (no server-side audio processing)

## Definition of Done

- Project initializes and runs without errors
- All folder structure is in place
- Dependencies are installed and configured
- Development environment is properly set up
- Basic placeholder structure exists for future development
