# Ticket #3: Base Skeuomorphic Design

## Description

Create a simplified skeuomorphic answering machine interface with essential visual elements that resemble a classic physical answering machine device.

## Priority

High - Core visual foundation

## Dependencies

- Ticket #1: Project Setup (must be completed first)

## Acceptance Criteria

### Main Device Structure

- [ ] Create rectangular device body with rounded edges
- [ ] Apply realistic depth with CSS shadows and gradients
- [ ] Design centered layout that works on various screen sizes
- [ ] Use classic answering machine color scheme (beige/grey tones)

### Cassette Tape Section

- [ ] Design cassette tape visual in the center of the device
- [ ] Create two circular tape reels/wheels within the cassette
- [ ] Implement spinning animation for the wheels during recording
- [ ] Style cassette with realistic depth and shadows

### Control Buttons

- [ ] Design two circular buttons beneath the cassette tape
- [ ] Create "Record" button with appropriate styling and icon
- [ ] Create "Stop" button with appropriate styling and icon
- [ ] Apply tactile button effects (raised appearance, hover states)

### Text Display Area

- [ ] Add small text section at the top of the device
- [ ] Style as a simple digital display or label area
- [ ] Ensure text is readable and properly sized

### Recording Indicator

- [ ] Implement blinking red light to indicate recording status
- [ ] Position indicator prominently on the device
- [ ] Create smooth blinking animation (on/off cycle)
- [ ] Ensure indicator is clearly visible during recording

## Technical Notes

- Use CSS3 for all visual effects (gradients, shadows, transforms)
- Optimize for performance - avoid heavy images where possible
- Ensure design works without JavaScript (progressive enhancement)
- Plan for future animation integration points

## Assets Needed

- Background textures (if not CSS-generated)
- Device color swatches and design specifications
- Reference images of classic answering machines

## Definition of Done

- Main answering machine interface is visually complete
- Design looks realistic and three-dimensional
- Base layout is responsive and accessible
- Visual foundation is ready for interactive elements
- Code is clean and well-organized
