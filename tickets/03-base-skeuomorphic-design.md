# Ticket #3: Base Skeuomorphic Design

## Description

Create the main skeuomorphic answering machine interface with realistic styling that resembles a physical answering machine device.

## Priority

High - Core visual foundation

## Dependencies

- Ticket #1: Project Setup (must be completed first)

## Acceptance Criteria

### Layout Structure

- [ ] Create main answering machine component with proper proportions
- [ ] Design centered layout that works on various screen sizes
- [ ] Implement proper spacing and padding for realistic device appearance
- [ ] Create container with appropriate width/height ratios

### Visual Design Elements

- [ ] Apply realistic textures and materials:
  - Brushed metal or plastic finish
  - Subtle gradients for depth
  - Realistic shadows and highlights
  - Border radius for rounded corners
- [ ] Create depth with CSS box-shadows and layering
- [ ] Implement proper color scheme (classic answering machine colors)
- [ ] Add subtle noise or grain texture for authenticity

### Device Shape & Structure

- [ ] Design rectangular device body with realistic proportions
- [ ] Create raised button areas and recessed display area
- [ ] Add device feet/base for grounding
- [ ] Include subtle device branding area or logo space
- [ ] Design ventilation grilles or speaker mesh areas

### Visual Polish

- [ ] Ensure design feels tactile and three-dimensional
- [ ] Add subtle hover effects for interactive elements
- [ ] Implement proper contrast for accessibility
- [ ] Create consistent design language throughout
- [ ] Test visual appearance in different lighting conditions

### Responsive Foundation

- [ ] Ensure base design scales appropriately
- [ ] Maintain aspect ratio across different screen sizes
- [ ] Plan for mobile adaptation without losing skeuomorphic feel
- [ ] Test on various device types and orientations

## Technical Notes

- Use CSS3 for all visual effects (gradients, shadows, transforms)
- Optimize for performance - avoid heavy images where possible
- Ensure design works without JavaScript (progressive enhancement)
- Plan for future animation integration points

## Assets Needed

- Background textures (if not CSS-generated)
- Device color swatches and design specifications
- Reference images of classic answering machines

## Definition of Done

- Main answering machine interface is visually complete
- Design looks realistic and three-dimensional
- Base layout is responsive and accessible
- Visual foundation is ready for interactive elements
- Code is clean and well-organized
